## WEEK 7-8-9

### 3D-Reconstruction Exercise  

- The development done by my colleagues [vmartinezf](https://github.com/https://github.com/vmartinezf) and [jessiffmm](https://github.com/jessiffmm) has been integrated with the RADI (Robotics Academy Docker Image). 
- The exercise is already available in Robotics Academy and a Pull-Request([139](https://github.com/jderobot-hub/unibotics-exercises/pull/139)) has been created to add it to Unibotics.

- A [basic html template](https://github.com/JdeRobot/RoboticsAcademy/blob/master/exercises/assets/base.html) has been created with functionalities common to web template exercises.

- A RADI connection button has been added to all web template exercises. In this way only one button is created and this is extended to the other exercises avoiding having to create one for each one of them.
