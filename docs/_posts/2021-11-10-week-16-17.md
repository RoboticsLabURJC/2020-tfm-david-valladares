## WEEK 16-17   

### MonteCarlo Visual Location    
- We have replaced the robot with a blunt robot that has an integrated camera.

- A 3D viewer has been added that allows to paint the real position of the robot and also the estimated position in order to compare the trajectory.

- To show the estimated position in the 3D viewer and to be able to use the evaluator in unibotics, a function called GUI.showPose3D([posx,posy,poz]) has been developed.   
  
- The editor would now look like this:
