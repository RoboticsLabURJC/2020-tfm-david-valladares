## WEEK 6

## Robotics Academy

    - [Exercise](https://github.com/JdeRobot/RoboticsAcademy/tree/master/exercises/color_filter/web-template)
    - [Exercise Page](https://jderobot.github.io/RoboticsAcademy/exercises/ComputerVision/color_filter)

  
### Unibotics
- The exercise has been integrated ([unibotics-exercise-color-filter](https://github.com/jderobot-hub/unibotics-exercises/tree/master/exercises/color_filter)). It remains to create the entry in the production database.  

### Create a home page of exercises in Robotics Academy   
- I have been developing a [home page](https://github.com/JdeRobot/RoboticsAcademy/issues/756) that contains the available exercises and allows access to them.   
- A few finishing touches and it would be ready to make the Pull-Request.   

### Visual 3D reconstruction exercise
- I have been understanding and analyzing the [development](https://github.com/JdeRobot/RoboticsAcademy/issues/731) that my colleagues([vmartinezf](https://github.com/https://github.com/vmartinezf) and [jessiffmm](https://github.com/jessiffmm)) have made for this exercise.
