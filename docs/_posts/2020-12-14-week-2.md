## WEEK 2

1. I have added a Ros node with the USB camera for capturing images for the color filter exercise. It is necessary to adjust this development for a correct operation.   
    - To follow this process I have used as references:   
        [ROS Wiki](https://wiki.ros.org/usb_cam)      
2. I have looked at how the docker container is built for the [unibotics](https://github.com/jderobot-hub/unibotics-webserver/tree/master/docker_simulation) move to production.
