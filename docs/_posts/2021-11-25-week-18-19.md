## WEEK 18-19    

### Self-localization with SLAM technique   
- I have been studying two SLAM based algorithms, MonoSLAM and PTAM. I have decided to move towards PTAM because of the advantages it introduces over the other one.    
  - PTAM allows relocation   
  - Manage more points   
  - The location is more precise   

- First I am developing a solution using a real camera, and then I will take it to the simulated exercise.

- To Do:    
  - Finalize the algorithm to run in the simulator    

### MonteCarlo Visual Location    

- We decided to use an algorithm that uses the ceiling and a single pixel of the image to self-localize.      
- A roomba model with the camera facing the ceiling has been added.   
- A ceiling model is being designed that has enough textures for the robot to be able to locate itself.   

- To Do:
  - Finalizing the roof model
