## WEEK 5

### Color Filter Exercise
- We have developed a new version of the color filter. Using directly openCV to read from the camera. This offers better performance compared to using WebRtc and RosNode.
- I have created the Pull Request necessary to update the Radi with what is necessary for the color filter.  
- I have also updated the page corresponding to the exercise.
- Here you can check the development carried out:
