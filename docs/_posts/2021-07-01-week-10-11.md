## WEEK 10-11

### OpticalFlow Teleoperator Exercise  

- A new exercise has been developed which consists of teleoperating through a camera using an optical flow algorithm.

- What is optical flow?   
  - Optical flow is the pattern of apparent motion of image objects between two consecutive frames caused by the movement of object or camera. It is 2D vector field where each vector is a displacement vector showing the movement of points from first frame to second. Consider the image below:

  - Optical flow works on several assumptions:   
    1. The pixel intensities of an object do not change between consecutive frames.  
    2. Neighbouring pixels have similar motion.

- This exercise has been added to both [RoboticsAcademy](https://jderobot.github.io/RoboticsAcademy/) and [Unibotics](https://unibotics.org/)   

- The [documentation necessary](https://jderobot.github.io/RoboticsAcademy/exercises/ComputerVision/opticalflow_teleop) to use the exercise has been added.    

- A [reference solution](https://github.com/RoboticsLabURJC/2020-tfm-david-valladares/blob/main/Exercises/OpticalFlow_Teleop/opticalflow_teleop.py) has been developed for the exercise   

- You can watch a video about the exercise, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUpTw0_jt5s)
